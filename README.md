# DE_CAI_broadband
This is part of a study on how community anchor institutions can promote broadband access.
We still have to define a research question.

The data comes from the FCC. Three databases are used:
  - bdc_10_Copper_fixed_broadband_123122.csv
  - bdc_10_Cable_fixed_broadband_123122.csv
  - bdc_10_Fiber-to-the-Premises_fixed_broadband_123122.csv
The data comes from this website: https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/data-download/nationwide-data?version=dec2022
